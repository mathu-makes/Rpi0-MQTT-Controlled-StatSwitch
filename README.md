# Rpi0-MQTT-Controlled-ThermostatSwitch
Rpi0 Access Point + MQTT broker for remote Sonoff control

Goal of project was to modify commercially available Sonoff WiFi smart switch devices and allow for local MQTT switching rather than via Sonoff cloud service. The intended use of the project was to act as thermostat switch for a boiler.
This project helped in my learning to:

    - download and install Raspbian to the Rpi0
    - update and upgrade the pi via the command line
    - follow guides to setup pi as WiFi access-point
    - use the command line to install libraries such as Mosquitto
    - design a MQTT flow using Node-Red
    - understand Tasmota firmware for home automation
